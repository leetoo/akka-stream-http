# akka-stream-http
This is just a playground to test what Roland Kuhn showed in his demo at ScalaDays 2015 in March.

I discovered that many things changed and need to practice these concepts.

Also I followed the Streams cookbook http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/1.0-RC3/scala/stream-cookbook.html
which is real useful and interesting but difficult to have life, due to the constant changes of the functions involved and the many omissions which makes it very difficult to replicate it.
